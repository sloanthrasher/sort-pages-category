### Streamlining Your WordPress Admin: How to Sort and Categorize Pages Easily

Managing a WordPress site with numerous pages can become quite a task, especially when trying to maintain a logical order and assign relevant categories to each page. To simplify this process, I’ve developed the Sort Pages Plugin, a simple, user-friendly tool designed to help you organize your pages effortlessly.

#### What is the Sort & Categorize Pages Plugin?

The Sort Pages Plugin is a versatile WordPress plugin that allows you to rearrange your pages with simple drag-and-drop functionality and assign categories to them through an intuitive dropdown menu. This plugin seamlessly integrates with your WordPress admin dashboard, adding a new menu item under the Appearance section.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

1. Download the plugin files and upload them to your WordPress site’s `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

#### Using the Plugin

Once installed, Sort And Categorize Pages will appear in the Appearance menu in the admin section of your site.

1. Navigate to `Appearance > Sort And Categorize Pages` in your WordPress admin dashboard.
1. Upon clicking the menu item, you’ll be presented with a list of your pages. This list will show the current order, the title of each page, and the assigned category (if any).
1. To reorder the pages, simply drag and drop the rows into the desired sequence. You can also select a category for each page from the dropdown menu.
1. **NOTE:** When saving the page, category assignents will be overridden. This may be important if you have assigned multiple categories using another method in WordPress.
1. Once you’ve made your changes, click the `Save Changes` button at the bottom of the list to save your new order and category assignments.

### Tips for Effective Page Management

- **Pre-Create Categories:** Before using this utility, ensure you’ve created all the categories you need, including any sub-categories. This preparation will save time and streamline the assignment process.
- **Use with Other Plugins:** If you’re using the Pages By Category and Sub-Categories plugin, the levels of the categories will be reflected in the page lists it generates, providing a cohesive experience.
- **Regularly Save Changes:** Always click the `Save Changes` button before leaving the page to ensure your adjustments are saved.

### Conclusion

The Sort Pages Plugin is a useful tool for any WordPress admin looking to maintain a well-organized page structure, especially if your theme does not support setting the order of pages. By simplifying the process of sorting pages and assigning categories, this plugin helps you keep your site intuitive and user-friendly.

### Support My Programming Addiction!

I love writing software and have been doing so for several decades. This plugin is offered free of charge, and you are welcome to use it on as many sites as you like, without any fee. Now that I am retired, instead of doing others’ bidding, I get to choose what I want to work on. However, even after retirement, I can’t seem to stay away from my computer, continually creating web pages, programs, and plugins. I even get the shakes if I’m away from my computer for a few days!

If you have found this plugin useful, and it has saved you time and effort, I would greatly appreciate a small token of your thanks. You might buy me a fancy coffee, a fast food lunch, or even dinner with my sweetheart. [Click here to make a donation](#).
